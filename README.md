About : 

- This App implements AngularJS and Flicker API. It is an image search engine with called <em><strong>Memories</strong></em> . 

Bugs and Achievements: 

- Understanding how to make AJAX calls is a topic that I struggled in the past, however this project gave me the oportunity to dig deeper and feel more confident about it. 

- I am very proud of the simplicity of the design and the the theme; coding is creating a virtual world, why not make it attractive and fun! I make use of media-queries and bootstrap to achieve a responsive design. 

- At this point, I am still digesting the concept of $q service, I understand that it is being used implicity by the $http service, however I have seen implicit use of the $q service, which I dont understand 100%. My goal is to refactor the project and implement the $q service and timeouts. I think of $q service as a promise within a promise($http()). But what is the point?

- The animations are very basic, and is a topic I want to master, I want my users to love the experience in each app I create.
